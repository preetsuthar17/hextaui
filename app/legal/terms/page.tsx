          HextaUI is provided “as is” and “as available”. Components and blocks
          are carefully built and tested, but there’s no guarantee they are free
          of bugs or fit your project. Test them in your product before you

          or consequential damages, such as lost profits or data, arising from
          your use of HextaUI. My total liability for any claim is limited to
          the amount you paid for HextaUI Pro in the 12 months before the claim.
          Nothing here limits rights you have that can’t be waived by law.

          the latest version, and material changes will be announced on the
          site. Continuing to use HextaUI after a change means you accept it.
