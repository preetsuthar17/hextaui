        This license covers the code of HextaUI Pro blocks. It applies when you
        buy HextaUI Pro, and lasts as long as you follow it. The free components

      <LegalSection title="What you get">
        <DocsParagraph>
          A perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable license for
          the people your plan covers to use, copy and modify Pro blocks in
          their own end products. Solo covers you, the buyer. Team covers the
          buyer and up to nine teammates they give a seat on their account page.
          Free blocks, like Prompt Input, are covered the same way for anyone
          who installs them. An end product is an app, website or piece of
          software where the blocks are part of something larger, not a
          collection of the blocks themselves.

        <DocsParagraph>
          Each developer who installs or works on Pro code needs a seat: their
          own Solo plan, or a seat on a Team plan. A Team plan has 10 seats,
          including the buyer’s. The buyer can move a seat from one teammate to
          another at any time, and the team may keep one shared API token in
          continuous integration and build systems. Clients and colleagues who
          only use the finished product don’t need a seat.

          or break these terms. When it ends, stop using Pro code in new work
          and remove it from your projects.
