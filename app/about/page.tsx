        <DocsParagraph>
          HextaUI has {docsComponents.length} components, {docsHooks.length}{" "}
          hooks and {docsUtilities.length} utilities for React. They keep the
          shadcn/ui API, sit on Base UI for behavior and accessibility, and are
          styled with Tailwind CSS v4. You add them with the shadcn CLI, the
          source lands in your project, and from then on it is your code.

          The point is the work you would otherwise do yourself: interruptible
          motion with reduced-motion fallbacks, keyboard and screen reader
          support, touch-sized targets, right-to-left layouts and the loading,
          empty and error states every real interface needs.
